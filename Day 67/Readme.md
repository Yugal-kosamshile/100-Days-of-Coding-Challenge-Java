# Day 67: Merge Two Sorted Lists

## 📝 Description

On Day 67 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented a method to merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list. This involves iterating through both lists simultaneously and selecting the smaller element to build a new sorted list.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to merge two sorted linked lists.
- Practice using pointers to achieve sorted merging of lists.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Defines a `Node` class representing each element in the linked lists.
2. Implements methods to add nodes to each list and merge them.
3. Traverses both lists simultaneously, inserting nodes in sorted order into a new list.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Merging sorted lists.
- Handling linked list pointers to combine two lists efficiently.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 67/`
  - `MergeSortedLists.java`: The main Java program to merge two sorted linked lists.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac MergeSortedLists.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java MergeSortedLists
   ```

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
List 1: 1 -> 3 -> 5
List 2: 2 -> 4 -> 6
Merged List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
```
