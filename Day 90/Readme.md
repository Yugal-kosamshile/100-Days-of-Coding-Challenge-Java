## **Day 90: File Compression Using GZIP**

## 📝 Description

On Day 90 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented a Java program to compress a file using GZIP. This program reads an input file, compresses it, and writes the compressed data to a `.gz` file.

### **Objective:**
- Understand GZIP compression in Java.
- Use `GZIPOutputStream` to compress files efficiently.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This program:
1. Takes an input file.
2. Compresses it using `GZIPOutputStream`.
3. Outputs the compressed file with a `.gz` extension.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- File I/O operations.
- GZIP compression in Java.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 90/`
  - `FileCompressor.java`: Java program to compress a file.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Prepare an input file:**
   Place a text file named `input.txt` in the program directory.

2. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac FileCompressor.java
   ```

3. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java FileCompressor
   ```

4. **Output:**
   A compressed file `compressed.gz` will be created.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
File compressed successfully: compressed.gz
```

**Day 90 complete!** On to Day 91!
