# Day 48: Count the Occurrences of a Character in a String

## 📝 Description

On Day 48 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to count the occurrences of a specific character in a given string. The program takes a string and a character as input and counts how many times the character appears in the string.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to traverse a string and count specific characters.
- Practice string manipulation and character comparison.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Accepts a string and a character from the user.
2. Iterates through the string and counts how many times the specified character appears.
3. Displays the count of occurrences of the character.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- String traversal using loops.
- Character comparison and counting.
- Basic input/output handling in Java.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 48/`
  - `CountCharacterOccurrences.java`: The main Java program to count occurrences of a character in a string.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac CountCharacterOccurrences.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java CountCharacterOccurrences
   ```
3. **Enter a string and a character** to see how many times the character occurs in the string.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter a string: hello world
Enter the character to count: l
The character 'l' appears 3 time(s) in the string.
```

If the character doesn't appear in the string:
```plaintext
Enter a string: hello world
Enter the character to count: z
The character 'z' appears 0 time(s) in the string.
```
