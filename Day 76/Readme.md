# Day 76: Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) for a BST

## 📝 Description

On Day 76 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented the Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal for a Binary Search Tree (BST). In BFS, nodes are visited level by level from top to bottom, left to right.

### **Objective:**
- Implement BFS (also known as level-order traversal) for a BST.
- Use a queue to traverse each level in order.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Defines a `Node` class for each node in the BST.
2. Uses a queue to perform BFS and display nodes level by level.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Queue-based traversal of trees.
- Level-order traversal of a binary tree.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 76/`
  - `BinarySearchTreeBFS.java`: Java program to perform BFS traversal.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac BinarySearchTreeBFS.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java BinarySearchTreeBFS
   ```

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Adding: 10
Adding: 5
Adding: 15
Adding: 3
Adding: 7
BFS Traversal: 10 5 15 3 7
```
