# Day 57: Calculate the Square Root of a Number

## 📝 Description

On Day 57 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to calculate the square root of a given number. This program uses the built-in `Math.sqrt()` function in Java, but it can also be extended to calculate square roots using iterative methods like the **Newton-Raphson** method.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to use the `Math.sqrt()` function in Java.
- Understand the concept of square roots and how to calculate them programmatically.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Accepts a number from the user.
2. Calculates the square root of the number using the `Math.sqrt()` function.
3. Outputs the result.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Using the `Math` library for square root calculation.
- Handling cases where the input number is negative.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 57/`
  - `SquareRoot.java`: The main Java program to calculate the square root of a number.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac SquareRoot.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java SquareRoot
   ```
3. **Enter a number** to find its square root.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter a number: 25
The square root of 25 is: 5.0

Enter a number: 49
The square root of 49 is: 7.0

Enter a number: -9
Square root of negative numbers is not real.
```
