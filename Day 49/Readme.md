# Day 49: Merge Sort Algorithm

## 📝 Description

On Day 49 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented the Merge Sort algorithm in Java. Merge Sort is a classic divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits an array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together in sorted order.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to implement the merge sort algorithm.
- Practice sorting algorithms and recursion.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Accepts an array of integers from the user.
2. Recursively splits the array into two halves until the size becomes 1.
3. Merges the subarrays back together in sorted order.
4. Outputs the sorted array.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Divide-and-conquer approach in algorithms.
- Recursion for dividing the array.
- Merging sorted subarrays back into a single sorted array.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 49/`
  - `MergeSort.java`: The main Java program implementing the Merge Sort algorithm.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac MergeSort.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java MergeSort
   ```
3. **Enter an array of integers** to see the array sorted using Merge Sort.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter the number of elements in the array: 5
Enter the elements of the array: 38 27 43 3 9
Sorted array: 3 9 27 38 43
```
