# Day 68: Convert a Linked List to an Array

## 📝 Description

On Day 68 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented a method to convert a linked list into an array. This is useful when we need to work with linked list data in a more flexible or random-access format, which arrays provide.

### **Objective:**
- Convert a linked list into an array to enable random-access operations.
- Practice linked list traversal and data storage in arrays.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Defines a `Node` class representing each element in the linked list.
2. Implements methods to add nodes to the list and convert the list into an array.
3. Traverses the list, storing each element into an array which is then returned and displayed.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Linked list traversal.
- Array creation and population.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 68/`
  - `LinkedListToArray.java`: The main Java program to convert a linked list to an array.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac LinkedListToArray.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java LinkedListToArray
   ```

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Adding 10
Adding 20
Adding 30
Adding 40
Linked List to Array: [10, 20, 30, 40]
```
