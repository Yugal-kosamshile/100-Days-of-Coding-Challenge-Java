# Day 62: Implement a Queue Using Arrays

## 📝 Description

On Day 62 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented a **Queue** data structure using arrays in Java. A queue is a linear data structure that follows the **First In First Out (FIFO)** principle. 

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to implement a queue using arrays.
- Understand basic queue operations: `enqueue` (add), `dequeue` (remove), and `peek` (view front element).

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Implements a fixed-size queue using an array.
2. Provides `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, and `peek()` operations, with boundary checks for full and empty states.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Queue operations: `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `peek`.
- Array-based implementation and handling of circular queue properties.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac QueueUsingArray.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java QueueUsingArray
   ```

## 🔍 Example Output
```plaintext
Enqueueing 10
Enqueueing 20
Front element: 10
Dequeuing: 10
Front element after dequeue: 20
```
