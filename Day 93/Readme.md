# Day 93: Create a Basic Swing Application

## 📝 Description

On Day 93 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I created a basic graphical application using Swing in Java. Swing is a lightweight GUI toolkit for creating desktop applications.

### **Objective:**
- Build a simple window using Swing.
- Display a "Hello, Swing!" message.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Creates a `JFrame` as the main window.
2. Adds a `JLabel` to display a message.
3. Sets up basic properties like frame size and visibility.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Java Swing.
- GUI components like `JFrame` and `JLabel`.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 93/`
  - `BasicSwingApp.java`: Java program implementing a Swing application.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac BasicSwingApp.java


2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java BasicSwingApp
   ```

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
A window opens with a message displayed:
