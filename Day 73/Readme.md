# Day 73: Check if a BST is Balanced

## 📝 Description

On Day 73 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented a function to check if a Binary Search Tree (BST) is balanced. A balanced tree is one where the height difference between any node's left and right subtrees is at most 1.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to determine if a tree is balanced.
- Implement a recursive function that checks the height balance of each subtree.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Defines a `Node` class to represent each node in the BST.
2. Provides methods to add elements and check if the tree is balanced.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Recursive height calculation.
- Tree balancing concepts.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 73/`
  - `BalancedBSTChecker.java`: The Java program to check if a BST is balanced.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac BalancedBSTChecker.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java BalancedBSTChecker
   ```

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Adding: 10
Adding: 5
Adding: 15
Adding: 7
Is the BST balanced? Yes
```
