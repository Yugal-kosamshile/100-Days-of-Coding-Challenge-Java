# Day 86: Handle HTTP Response Codes

## 📝 Description

On Day 86 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented a program to handle different HTTP response codes.

### **Objective:**
- Send an HTTP GET request.
- Handle and display the HTTP response codes, such as:
  - `200 OK`: Request successful
  - `404 Not Found`: Resource not found

## 🚀 Code Overview

This program:
1. Sends an HTTP GET request to a URL.
2. Checks and handles common HTTP response codes.
3. Outputs a custom message based on the response.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 86/`
  - `HttpResponseCodes.java`: Java program to handle HTTP response codes.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac HttpResponseCodes.java
2. **Run the program**
```bash
    java HttpResponseCodes

##🔍 Example Output
```
Response Code: 404
Error: Resource not found.

```
**Day 86 complete!** On to Day 87!
