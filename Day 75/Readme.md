# Day 75: Implement Depth-First Search (DFS) for a BST

## 📝 Description

On Day 75 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal methods for a Binary Search Tree (BST). DFS in a tree can be performed in three orders: in-order, pre-order, and post-order.

### **Objective:**
- Implement DFS traversal methods for a BST.
- Understand how each DFS traversal order affects the output.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Defines a `Node` class to represent each node in the BST.
2. Provides methods for in-order, pre-order, and post-order DFS traversals.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Recursive traversal techniques for binary trees.
- In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal algorithms.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 75/`
  - `BinarySearchTreeDFS.java`: Java program to perform DFS traversals.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac BinarySearchTreeDFS.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java BinarySearchTreeDFS
   ```

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Adding: 10
Adding: 5
Adding: 15
Adding: 7
In-Order Traversal: 5 7 10 15
Pre-Order Traversal: 10 5 7 15
Post-Order Traversal: 7 5 15 10
```
