# Day 64: Reverse a Linked List

## 📝 Description

On Day 64 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented a method to reverse a linked list in Java. Reversing a linked list involves reordering its nodes so the last node becomes the first, and each node points to its previous node instead of the next.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to reverse a singly linked list.
- Practice manipulating pointers to achieve reverse traversal in a linked list.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Defines a `Node` class to represent each element in the linked list.
2. Provides a `reverse()` method to reverse the order of nodes in the list.
3. Allows adding nodes to the list and displaying the list before and after reversal.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Reversing linked list pointers.
- Manipulating nodes in a singly linked list.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 64/`
  - `ReverseLinkedList.java`: Main Java file to reverse the linked list.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac ReverseLinkedList.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java ReverseLinkedList
   ```

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Original Linked List: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40
Reversed Linked List: 40 -> 30 -> 20 -> 10
```
