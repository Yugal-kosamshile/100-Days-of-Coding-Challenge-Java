# Day 85: Handle HTTP POST Request Using Java

## 📝 Description

On Day 85 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented an HTTP POST request in Java to send JSON data to a server.

### **Objective:**
- Send an HTTP POST request with JSON data.
- Retrieve and display the server's response.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This program:
1. Connects to a specified URL using `HttpURLConnection`.
2. Sends JSON data as part of the POST request.
3. Displays the response returned by the server.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 85/`
  - `HttpPostRequest.java`: Java program to send an HTTP POST request.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac HttpPostRequest.java
 2. **Run the programm
 ```bash
  java HttpPostRequest

##🔍 Example Output

Response Code: 201
Response: {"id":101,"title":"foo","body":"bar","userId":1}
```

**Day 85 complete!** On to Day 86!
