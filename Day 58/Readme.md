# Day 58: Implement a Priority Queue

## üìù Description

On Day 58 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented a **Priority Queue** in Java. A Priority Queue is an abstract data structure where each element has a priority, and elements with higher priority are dequeued before elements with lower priority. If two elements have the same priority, they are dequeued in the order they were enqueued (depending on the implementation).

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to use Java's `PriorityQueue` class.
- Implement basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and accessing the highest-priority element.

## üöÄ Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Uses the built-in `PriorityQueue` class in Java to maintain elements in sorted order based on priority.
2. Accepts elements with assigned priorities.
3. Supports operations such as inserting elements, accessing the highest-priority element, and removing elements.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Java's `PriorityQueue` class.
- Custom comparator functions to assign priorities.
- Basic queue operations (insertion, access, removal).

## üìÇ File Structure
- `Day 58/`
  - `PriorityQueueExample.java`: The main Java program to implement a priority queue.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## üìã How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac PriorityQueueExample.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java PriorityQueueExample
   ```
3. **Interact with the priority queue** by adding elements, viewing the highest-priority element, and removing elements.

## üîç Example Input/Output

```plaintext
Inserting elements into the Priority Queue...
Highest-priority element: 1
Polling (removing) the highest-priority element: 1
Highest-priority element after removal: 3
```
