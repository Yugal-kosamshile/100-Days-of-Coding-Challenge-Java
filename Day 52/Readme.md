# Day 52: Find the Second Largest Number in an Array

## 📝 Description

On Day 52 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to find the second largest number in an array. The program traverses the array to identify the largest and second-largest unique elements.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to traverse an array efficiently.
- Implement logic to find the second-largest number.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Accepts an array of integers from the user.
2. Traverses the array to identify the largest and second-largest unique elements.
3. Outputs the second-largest number or a message if no second-largest exists.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Array traversal and comparison.
- Efficiently finding the second largest number in a single pass.
- Handling edge cases (such as arrays with fewer than two distinct numbers).

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 52/`
  - `SecondLargestInArray.java`: The main Java program to find the second largest number in an array.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac SecondLargestInArray.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java SecondLargestInArray
   ```
3. **Enter an array of integers** to find the second largest number.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter the number of elements in the array: 5
Enter the elements of the array: 3 9 1 9 7
The second largest number is: 7
```

If there is no second largest number:
```plaintext
Enter the number of elements in the array: 3
Enter the elements of the array: 5 5 5
There is no second largest number in the array.
```
