# Day 70: Count Elements in a HashMap

## 📝 Description

On Day 70 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented a way to count the number of elements in a HashMap. This involves keeping track of elements as they’re added or removed.

### **Objective:**
- Implement a counter for the number of elements in a HashMap.
- Practice managing state for efficient count tracking.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Implements a simple HashMap with add, get, remove, and count operations.
2. Keeps track of the number of elements with a `count` variable.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Managing state for counting.
- HashMap operations with minimal code.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 70/`
  - `CountHashMap.java`: The Java program to count elements in a HashMap.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac CountHashMap.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java CountHashMap
   ```

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Adding key: 1, value: "A"
Adding key: 2, value: "B"
Current count: 2
Removing key: 1
Current count: 1
```
