# Day 65: Find the Length of a Linked List

## 📝 Description

On Day 65 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented a method to calculate the length of a linked list in Java. The length of a linked list is the total number of nodes it contains. By traversing each node from the head to the end of the list, we can count and determine the list's length.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to traverse a linked list to count its elements.
- Practice using pointers to manage traversal and counting in a linked list.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Defines a `Node` class representing each element in the linked list.
2. Implements methods to add nodes and calculate the length of the linked list.
3. Traverses through each node to count and display the total number of elements.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Linked list traversal.
- Counting elements in a singly linked list.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 65/`
  - `LengthOfLinkedList.java`: The main Java program to find the length of a linked list.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac LengthOfLinkedList.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java LengthOfLinkedList
   ```

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Adding 10
Adding 20
Adding 30
Adding 40
Linked List: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40
Length of Linked List: 4
```
