# Day 63: Implement a Linked List

## 📝 Description

On Day 63 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented a **Linked List** in Java. A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next node, forming a chain. Unlike arrays, linked lists are dynamic and can grow or shrink in size as needed.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to implement a linked list from scratch.
- Perform basic operations like inserting, deleting, and displaying elements.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Defines a simple `Node` class representing each element in the list.
2. Implements a linked list class with operations like `add()`, `delete()`, and `display()`.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Linked list basics and node manipulation.
- Basic linked list operations (insertion, deletion, traversal).

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac LinkedList.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java LinkedList
   ```

## 🔍 Example Output
```plaintext
Adding 10
Adding 20
Adding 30
Linked List: 10 -> 20 -> 30
Deleting 20
Linked List after deletion: 10 -> 30
```
