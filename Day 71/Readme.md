# Day 71: Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST)

## 📝 Description

On Day 71 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented a simple Binary Search Tree (BST) in Java. A BST is a data structure that maintains ordered data, allowing efficient insertion, lookup, and deletion.

### **Objective:**
- Learn the structure of a binary search tree.
- Implement add, search, and traversal operations.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Defines a `Node` class to represent each node in the BST.
2. Provides methods to add elements, search for values, and perform in-order traversal (which prints the BST in sorted order).

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Recursive insertion and search.
- Tree traversal techniques.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 71/`
  - `BinarySearchTree.java`: The main Java program implementing the BST.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac BinarySearchTree.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java BinarySearchTree
   ```

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Adding: 10
Adding: 5
Adding: 15
Adding: 7
In-Order Traversal: 5 7 10 15
Search for 7: Found
Search for 12: Not found
```
