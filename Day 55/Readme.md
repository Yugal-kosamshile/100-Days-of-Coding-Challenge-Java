# Day 55: Count the Number of Digits in a Number

## 📝 Description

On Day 55 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to count the number of digits in a given number. This program uses basic division operations to determine how many digits are present in an integer.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to count the number of digits in a number.
- Implement logic that works for both positive and negative numbers.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Accepts a number from the user.
2. Counts the number of digits in the number.
3. Outputs the count of digits.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Division and modulo operations.
- Handling negative numbers.
- Counting digits efficiently using loops.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 55/`
  - `CountDigits.java`: The main Java program to count the number of digits in a number.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac CountDigits.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java CountDigits
   ```
3. **Enter a number** to count the number of digits in that number.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter a number: 12345
The number of digits is: 5

Enter a number: -9876
The number of digits is: 4
```
