# Day 51: Find the Largest Prime Factor

## 📝 Description

On Day 51 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to find the largest prime factor of a given number. A prime factor is a factor of a number that is a prime number.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to find the prime factors of a number.
- Implement logic to calculate the largest prime factor.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Accepts a number from the user.
2. Finds all prime factors of the number.
3. Outputs the largest prime factor.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Prime number identification.
- Efficient factorization of large numbers.
- Handling input and output in Java.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 51/`
  - `LargestPrimeFactor.java`: The main Java program to find the largest prime factor.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac LargestPrimeFactor.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java LargestPrimeFactor
   ```
3. **Enter a number** to find its largest prime factor.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter a number: 13195
The largest prime factor is: 29
```
