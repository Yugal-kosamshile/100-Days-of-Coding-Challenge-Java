# Day 53: Check if a Number is a Perfect Number

## 📝 Description

On Day 53 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to check if a given number is a **Perfect Number**. A Perfect Number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to find the divisors of a number.
- Implement logic to check if the number is a perfect number.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Accepts a number from the user.
2. Finds the divisors of the number (excluding the number itself).
3. Sums the divisors and checks if the sum equals the original number.
4. Outputs whether the number is a perfect number.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Looping through numbers to find divisors.
- Summing divisors to check if the number is perfect.
- Basic arithmetic and comparison in Java.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 53/`
  - `PerfectNumber.java`: The main Java program to check if a number is a perfect number.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac PerfectNumber.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java PerfectNumber
   ```
3. **Enter a number** to check if it's a perfect number.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter a number: 6
6 is a perfect number.

Enter a number: 28
28 is a perfect number.

Enter a number: 10
10 is not a perfect number.
```
