# Day 56: Check if a Number is a Strong Number

## 📝 Description

On Day 56 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to check if a given number is a **Strong Number**. A Strong Number is a number in which the sum of the factorial of its digits equals the original number. For example, 145 is a Strong Number because 1! + 4! + 5! = 145.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to calculate the factorial of digits.
- Implement logic to determine whether the sum of factorials of digits equals the original number.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Accepts a number from the user.
2. Calculates the factorial of each digit.
3. Sums the factorials and checks if the result equals the original number.
4. Outputs whether the number is a Strong Number.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Factorial calculation using loops or recursion.
- Modulo and division operations to extract digits.
- Checking if a number is a Strong Number.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 56/`
  - `StrongNumber.java`: The main Java program to check if a number is a Strong Number.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac StrongNumber.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java StrongNumber
   ```
3. **Enter a number** to check if it's a Strong Number.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter a number: 145
145 is a Strong Number.

Enter a number: 123
123 is not a Strong Number.
```
