# Day 77: Implement a Simple Calculator with GUI

## üìù Description

On Day 77 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I created a basic calculator with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Java using the Swing library. This calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### **Objective:**
- Develop a simple GUI-based calculator in Java.
- Practice creating interactive Java Swing components.

## üöÄ Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Sets up a basic GUI for the calculator using `JFrame`, `JTextField`, and `JButton`.
2. Handles basic arithmetic operations.
3. Uses event listeners to handle button clicks for numbers and operators.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Java Swing for GUI development.
- Event handling for button clicks.
- Basic arithmetic operations.

## üìÇ File Structure
- `Day 77/`
  - `SimpleCalculatorGUI.java`: Java program for the calculator.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## üìã How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac SimpleCalculatorGUI.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java SimpleCalculatorGUI
   ```

## üîç Example Usage

The calculator allows you to:

- Enter numbers by pressing the buttons.
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- View the result when the `=` button is clicked.
